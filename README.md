# Mightex1304

This is a userland driver for the Mightex TCE-1304-u CCD line cameras. It is based on [libusb](https://libusb.info).

**Note:** at the moment it is all very preliminary. Do not expect a finished product, although it can prove helpful in understanding how to communicate with the camera using the public protocol provided by Mightex
